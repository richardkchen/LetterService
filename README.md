# LetterService

## Key Features

This program should do the following:
1. Archive the files from the Input folder to the Archive folder.

2. Find out students who have both admission letters and scholarship letters on the day of processing. Then combine letters for each student and save all combined letters to a place in the Output folder.

3. Generate a text report with today's date, the number of combined letters, and a list of student IDs that the combined letters are addressed to.
